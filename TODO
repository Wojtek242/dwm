- add a flag to Key to execute the command on release (needed for commands
		affecting the keyboard grab, see scrot -s for example)
- add updategeom() hook for external tools like dzen
- consider onscreenkeyboard hooks for tablet deployment

Wojtek's TODO
- separate selfrestart into a header and source file
- make dwm save the positons of windows so when restarted they open in the same place
- run certain programs on startup
